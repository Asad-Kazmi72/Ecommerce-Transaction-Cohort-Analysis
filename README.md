I’m happy to share that I’ve obtained a new certification: Analyzing E-commerce Transactions: Data Cleaning, Cohort Analysis, and SQL from HiCounselor!



In the fast-changing world of online shopping, I took on an exciting challenge as a data enthusiast. Using Python and SQL, I worked through three key phases: Data Cleanup, Cohort Analysis, and SQL Insights.



🧹 Phase 1: Data Cleanup

First, I cleaned up the data, making sure it was error-free and ready for analysis.



🔍 Phase 2: Cohort Analysis

Next, in Cohort Analysis, I uncovered insights about customer behavior and loyalty, akin to deciphering a code.



📈 Phase 3: SQL Insights

Lastly, I used SQL to find answers to critical questions, providing a comprehensive view of e-commerce.



This project, "Analyzing E-commerce Transactions: Data Cleaning, Cohort Analysis, and SQL," equipped me with skills to work with e-commerce data, conduct meaningful cohort analysis, and extract valuable insights. Now, I'm ready to help businesses thrive in the data-driven world of online shopping.
